# Malnutrition-Detection-Project-
This repository is about my project where I create Machine learning models using both image data and numeric data that is integrated into a mobile based Application so that parents can input details  of their children into the application and they can know whether their child is malnourished or not 
This can help in early detection of manutrition cases in infants and can then be treated early enough and more efficiently.
